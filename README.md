# DSA (Data Structures & Algorithms)

This repository is my personal learning workspace for Data Structures and Algorithms using Java. It contains practice problems, study notes, worked examples, and a progress log to help me track and improve my understanding over time.

## What this repo is for

- Track learning progress and milestones while studying DSA in Java.
- Store practice solutions, code examples, and small projects.
- Keep concise notes and explanations for concepts I want to remember.
- Build a habit of documenting learnings and improving by reworking solutions.

## Naming & coding conventions

- Java files: use PascalCase for class names and file names (e.g., `TwoSum.java`).
- Keep each practice problem small and self-contained. One public class per file.
- Provide a short comment at the top explaining the problem statement and complexity.
- Prefer simple input examples or a short `main` method to demonstrate usage.

## How I track progress

- Use commits with clear messages like `solve: two-sum (array, O(n))` or `note: explain BFS`.
- Add a short entry to a topic's `README.md` or main `README.md` when a milestone is reached.

## How to run a practice file

From the repository root (or the folder with the `.java` file), compile and run Java files with:

```bash
javac Path/To/File/Example.java
java Path.To.File.Example
```

(Adjust the package name or classpath if files use packages.)

## Study plan ideas

- Fundamentals: arrays, strings, linked lists, stacks, queues, recursion.
- Algorithms: sorting, searching, two pointers, sliding window.
- Graphs & trees: DFS, BFS, binary trees, heaps.
- Dynamic programming: start with knapsack, Fibonacci variants, subsequence problems.

Work in small, focused sessions and write down one takeaway per solved problem.

## Contributing (for me)

- This is a personal learning repo. I will:
  - Keep solutions small and readable.
  - Revisit older solutions to refactor and optimize.

## Notes & tips

- Write short explanations beside code — it helps retention.
- Use branch/workspace per major topic if experimenting with larger projects.

Keep this README as a living document — update it as your workflow and structure evolve.
